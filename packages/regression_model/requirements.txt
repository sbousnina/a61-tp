# We use compatible release functionality (see PEP 440 here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#compatible-release)
# to specify acceptable version ranges of our project dependencies. This gives us the flexibility to keep up with small
# updates/fixes, whilst ensuring we don't install a major update which could introduce backwards incompatible changes.

# Note: Using compatible version ranges for better stability and compatibility.
# Currently tested with: numpy 2.3.4, pandas 2.3.3, scikit-learn 1.7.2
